=========================================

## Context

The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) released a PowerShell module named SpeculationControl on the Powershell Gallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SpeculationControl but didn't provided a ProjectURI in the metadata.
It's difficult to follow and track changes made to the code.
